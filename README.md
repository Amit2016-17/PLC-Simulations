# PLCsimulations

This is my collections of simulation of PLC tools. The tools I have been using are:

* Codesys V3 - Control Logic
* iX Developer - Graphical User Interface
* Simumatik 3D - Simulation
* Siemens LOGO - Control Logic

These software are made as industrial use for control engineering. Codesys V3 to program logic to PLC's hardware and iX Developer to design user interface for HMI tablets and Simumatik 3D for 3D simulations and testing before implementation. I have also been using Siemens LOGO which is a PLC for basic and inexpensive use.
